Title: Activity Tracker : to-do-list & tasks
 
Short-name: ATrax 

Category: Productivity 

Punch-line: Never forget about your plans again! 

Summary: Have you ever forgotten about something important you had to do? Have you ever let someone down because you forgot your plans together? NO MORE. Life can sometimes get complicated and your schedule too heavy. With this new revolutionary app you can keep track of all the activities you have planned by not trying to memorize them. The app is very simple and straight-forward. All it requires the user to do is add activities to his schedule section of the app from where he can add the “Task name”, “Description”, “Due date”, “Time”, “Repetitiveness”, “Notification”, “Importance”. Plans are often modified so the ability to alter tasks is also provided to you. We know that not all your plans are equally important and that a lot of them will be overlooked even though you have made them. That is where the new “Importance” feature comes to use. You can add 3 levels of importance (Low,Mid,High) to each task so that you can easily tell if something is worth doing after a long and stressful day. If the high importance option is not enough for you, you can schedule multiple notifications to alert you at a desired time. One other feature which is provided to all users is the ability to add friends via scanning their QR code as well as change their profile picture. The user can also add a Location, an Audio file or simply a Photograph via the Gallery or the Camera Roll. Finally the applications calendar shows all past and future events that have been completed and ignored.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
